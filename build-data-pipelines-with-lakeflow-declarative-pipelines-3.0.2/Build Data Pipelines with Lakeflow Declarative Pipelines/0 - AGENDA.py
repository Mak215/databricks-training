# MAGIC ## Build Data Pipeline with Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This course introduces users to the essential concepts and skills needed to build data pipelines using Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines
# MAGIC in Databricks for incremental batch or streaming ingestion and processing through multiple streaming tables and materialized views.
# MAGIC Designed for data engineers new to Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines, the course provides a comprehensive overview of core
# MAGIC components such as incremental data processing, streaming tables, materialized views, and temporary views, highlighting their
# MAGIC specific purposes and differences.
# MAGIC Topics covered include:
# MAGIC - Developing and debugging ETL pipelines with the multi-file editor in Lakeflow using SQL (with Python code examples provided)
# MAGIC - How Lakeflow Declarative Pipelines track data dependencies in a pipeline through the pipeline graph
# MAGIC - Configuring pipeline compute resources, data assets, trigger modes, and other advanced options
# MAGIC Next, the course introduces data quality expectations in Lakeflow, guiding users through the process of integrating expectations into
# MAGIC pipelines to validate and enforce data integrity. Learners will then explore how to put a pipeline into production, including scheduling
# MAGIC options, production mode, and enabling pipeline event logging to monitor pipeline performance and health.
# MAGIC Finally, the course covers how to implement Change Data Capture (CDC) using the APPLY CHANGES INTO syntax within Lakeflow
# MAGIC Declarative Pipelines to manage slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 1 and Type 2), preparing users to integrate CDC into their
# MAGIC own pipelines.
